        <ol>
            <li>Using a sharp knife, dice chicken into 1/3" thick pieces and place them in a large mixing bowl. Tip: If chicken breast is partially frozen, it will be a little bit easier to slice.</li>
            <li>Into the mixing bowl, add remaining batter ingredients: 2 eggs, 1/3 cup mayonnaise, 1/3 cup flour, 1 1/3 cups shredded mozzarella, 1 1/2 Tbsp dill, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp black pepper, or season to taste. Stir the mixture until well combined, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat and add 2 Tbsp oil. When oil is hot, add the chicken mixture a heaping Tablespoon at a time. Slightly flatten out the tops with the back of your spoon and saut√© uncovered 3-4 min on the first side, then flip and saute 3 min on the second side or until outsides are golden brown and chicken is fully cooked through</li>
            <li>To make the aioli (if using), combine all ingredients in a small bowl or measuring cup and stir together until smooth.</li>
        </ol>
